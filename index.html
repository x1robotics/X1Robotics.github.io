    <br>
    <p>My name is Prescott Rynewicz, and I was born and raised in San Jose California. I attended Leigh High School, and I am currently a third year Aerospace Engineer and Computer Scientist at UCLA. I am passionate about everything Aerospace, as well as software engineering, physical computing, control systems, and general robotics. I haved worked in fields that vary from Cubesat System engineering to Chemical Catalysis Research, with many areas in between.</p><br>
    <p>Outside of engineering and research, I am a passionate musician. I am the president of UCLA's only All Male A Cappella group, <a href= "http://www.BruinHarmony.com" target="_blank">Bruin Harmony</a>, and the founder of the UCLA A Cappella Council. I am also a member of the Lambda Chi Alpha Fraternity. </p><br>
    <p> This site serves as an professional profile to display my work experience and project updates.</p>

        <li><u>X1 Robotics at UCLA: Founder and Lead Project Engineer</u></li>
        <ul style="list-style-type:disc">
            <li>Founded X1 Robotics in the Winter of 2014 with the goal of developing career applicable engineering and problem solving skills outside of standard engineering curriculum.
            </li>
            <li>Currenting developing an iPhone controlled drone. All software for the project will be coded from scratch (or very close to). This includes the communications, iPhone app development, controls and flight software, and instrument integration.</li>
            <li> This project will use both the Arduino and Raspberry Pi platforms, along with multiple adafruit instruments and various electromechanical hardware.</li>
            <li>A Sample Research and Development Presentation is included below.</li>
