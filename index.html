    <br>
    <p> X1 Robotics was founded in the fall of 2015 by Prescott Rynewicz, an Aerospace Engineer and Computer Scientist at UCLA. X1's goal is to develop challenging Robotic systems from scratch in order to develop real world problem solving and engineering skills.</p><br>
    <p> At X1, we use the term <i>Robotics</i> loosely, in the sense that we are not just committed to building robots, but to the idea of lifelong learning and self motivation through the design and devlopment of engineered vehicle's, whether that is a small RC car, or a Free Throw Shooting Robot, or a Semi-Autonomous Drone.</p><br>
    <p> X1 is primarily an undergraduate organization, but is open to all UCLA students and anyone who is passionate about engineering and excited to be a part of team that takes ideas and turns them into reality.</p>

    <ul>
        <li><u>UCLA ELFIN CubeSat Project: Systems Engineer</u></li>
        <ul style="list-style-type:disc">
            <li>Worked with professional and student leadership teams to design and engineer a 3U cubesat to conduct science on high energy particle precipitation in Earth's radiation belts. </li>
            <li>Work with individual sub-systems to develope interface documents and verify sub-system requirements for flight.</li>
            <li>Design and conduct interface mating test proceudures, and verify that these tests meet sub-system requirements.</li>
        </ul><br>
        <li><u>Calera Chemicals: Catalysis Research Assistant</u></li>
        <ul style="list-style-type:disc">
            <li>Work with science and engineering teams to design and run high pressure experiments. The data from these experiments was used to improve the Space Time Yield and Selectivity of the Ethylene DiChloride Catalysis Reaction.</li>
            <li>Rewrote procedure documents for Parr Reactor system to improve data reliability and precision.</li>
            <li>Worked to improve gas chromatography analytical procedures to validate experimental results. Lead towards more consistent and reliable data.</li>

        <li><u>X1 Robotics at UCLA: Founder and Lead Project Engineer</u></li>
        <ul style="list-style-type:disc">
            <li>Founded X1 Robotics in the Winter of 2014 with the goal of developing career applicable engineering and problem solving skills outside of standard engineering curriculum.
            </li>
            <li>Currenting developing an iPhone controlled drone. All software for the project will be coded from scratch (or very close to). This includes the communications, iPhone app development, controls and flight software, and instrument integration.</li>
            <li> This project will use both the Arduino and Raspberry Pi platforms, along with multiple adafruit instruments and various electromechanical hardware.</li>
            <li>A Sample Research and Development Presentation is included below.</li>
