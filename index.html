    <br>
    <p> X1 Robotics was founded in the fall of 2015 by Prescott Rynewicz, an Aerospace Engineer and Computer Scientist at UCLA. X1's goal is to develop challenging Robotic systems from scratch in order to gain real world problem solving and engineering skills.</p><br>
    <p> At X1, we use the term <i>Robotics</i> loosely, in the sense that we are not just committed to building robots, but to the idea of lifelong learning and self motivation through the design and devlopment of engineered vehicle's, whether that is a small RC car, or a Free Throw Shooting Robot, or a Semi-Autonomous Drone.</p><br>
    <p> X1 is primarily an undergraduate organization, but is open to all UCLA students and anyone who is passionate about engineering and excited to be a part of team that takes ideas and turns them into reality.</p>
    <br><br>


<br><h3 id="Work"><u><i>Current Projects</i></u></h3>
    <br>
    <p> We are currently working on designing a Semi-Autonomous iPhone controlled drone, and are in the stages of Hardware research and development. There will be an attached pdf below this which presents a general overview of the project details, and a Mission timeline for the Project.</p><br>

        <ul style="list-style-type:disc">
            <li>Founded X1 Robotics in the Winter of 2014 with the goal of developing career applicable engineering and problem solving skills outside of standard engineering curriculum.
            </li>
            <li>Currenting developing an iPhone controlled drone. All software for the project will be coded from scratch (or very close to). This includes the communications, iPhone app development, controls and flight software, and instrument integration.</li>
            <li> This project will use both the Arduino and Raspberry Pi platforms, along with multiple adafruit instruments and various electromechanical hardware.</li>
            <li>A Sample Research and Development Presentation is included below.</li>
